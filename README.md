# Unit 03 Homework: Password Generator

## Description

I was tasked with creating a password penerator that will generate secure passwords for an employee with access to sensitive data. This password generator will generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters long, that contains at least one character of each type that the employee selects.

These character types include:
* Lowercase letters
* Uppercase letters
* Numbers
* Symbols

A new random password is generated each time, providing a strong password that will increase the security of the employee's data.
